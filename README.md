# xclaude

Run [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) against **any**
Anthropic-compatible AI API — pointed at **any endpoint**, using **any model**.

`deepseek` and `glm` are just built-in *presets* (they pre-fill the URL and
model so you can hit Enter). They are **not** the only options. You can point
this at:

- any provider's official Anthropic-compatible endpoint;
- a self-hosted or unofficial mirror / reseller;
- a multi-model **aggregator / gateway** — one endpoint that serves dozens of
  models (e.g. SumoPod, OpenRouter). Pick GLM, MiniMax, Mimo, Kimi, Qwen,
  DeepSeek, … from the same command — see
  [Aggregators](#aggregators-one-endpoint-many-models).

Install once, enter the API key once, and from then on just run the command it
gave you — it sets all the env vars and launches `claude` for you.

> Requires the `claude` CLI to already be installed
> ([instructions](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)).

## How naming works

The installer asks for a **name** and calls the command `<name>claude`. The
name is completely free-form — type whatever you like; it only affects the
command name and where the config is stored:

| You type    | Command you get   | Notes                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `deepseek`  | `deepseekclaude`  | preset: URL + models pre-filled        |
| `glm`       | `glmclaude`       | preset: URL + models pre-filled        |
| `sumopod`   | `sumopodclaude`   | anything else: you enter URL + model   |
| `mimo`      | `mimoclaude`      | name it after the model if you prefer  |

Only `deepseek` and `glm` have pre-filled defaults; every other name simply
prompts you for the URL and model. Nothing about the name limits which
provider or model you can use.

You can install as many as you like, side by side — each gets its own command
and its own stored config, so they never interfere with each other. Tip: if
one endpoint serves many models (an aggregator), name the command after the
**provider** (e.g. `sumopod`) and switch models inside it, rather than making
one command per model — see [Aggregators](#aggregators-one-endpoint-many-models).

## Install (one command)

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/andre4freelance/xclaude@main/install.sh | bash
```

Asks which provider you're setting up, then installs `<provider>claude` into
`~/.local/bin`. If that directory isn't on your `PATH`, the installer prints
the line to add. To skip the prompt (e.g. in scripts):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/andre4freelance/xclaude@main/install.sh | bash -s -- glm
```

> **Why jsDelivr and not `raw.githubusercontent.com`?** GitHub's raw host
> rate-limits (HTTP 429) aggressively on some networks. jsDelivr is a CDN
> that doesn't, so it's the reliable default. The `raw...` URL still works
> when you aren't limited — and once installed, the wrapper's own downloads
> (like `update`) automatically fall back across raw → GitHub API → jsDelivr,
> so you never depend on a single host.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/andre4freelance/xclaude@main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Installs `<provider>claude` into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\<provider>claude`
and adds it to your user `PATH`. Open a **new** terminal afterward.

> On Windows you can also use the macOS/Linux command above from **Git Bash**
> or **WSL**.

Run the installer again for each additional provider you want.

## Use

First run asks for the base URL, the model name(s), and the API key, then
saves them:

```bash
glmclaude
```

Every run after that just works — same config, no prompts. Any arguments
pass straight through to `claude`:

```bash
glmclaude "refactor this module"
glmclaude --help
```

### Known presets vs. custom / unofficial sources

If the name is a known preset (`deepseek`, `glm`), the base URL and model names
are pre-filled — press Enter to accept them, or type your own to override (a
self-hosted mirror, a reseller, an aggregator, any endpoint at all). Any other
name starts with empty fields and simply asks you for the URL and model, so
**you can use any provider and any model** — the presets are only there to save
typing for two common ones.

> **Base URL tip:** enter the endpoint **without** a trailing `/v1`. Claude Code
> speaks the Anthropic Messages API and appends `/v1/messages` itself, so a base
> of `https://host/v1` becomes `https://host/v1/v1/messages` → 404. Use
> `https://host` (the wrapper's `set-url` is the quick fix if you hit this).

### Aggregators: one endpoint, many models

Some providers are **aggregators / gateways** — a single Anthropic-compatible
endpoint (and one API key) that serves dozens of models. You do **not** install
one command per model. Install **one** command named after the aggregator, then
switch models freely.

Example — [SumoPod](https://ai.sumopod.com) (GLM, MiniMax, Mimo, Kimi, Qwen,
DeepSeek, GPT, Claude, …):

```bash
# 1. install one command for the aggregator
curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/andre4freelance/xclaude@main/install.sh | bash -s -- sumopod

# 2. first run: base URL = https://ai.sumopod.com  (no /v1), model = any id it
#    serves, key = your SumoPod key
sumopodclaude

# 3. switch the default model any time — no reinstall
sumopodclaude set-model mimo-v2.5-pro
sumopodclaude set-model MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed
sumopodclaude set-context auto        # match the new model's context window
```

You can also switch **per session, live**, with Claude Code's own `/model`
command — e.g. type `/model mimo-v2.5-pro` inside a running session (add `[1m]`
to the id if that model supports a 1M window). The wrapper only sets the
*default*; `/model` overrides it for any model the endpoint accepts.

### Ways to provide the key

The key is resolved in this order:

1. `<name>claude config <KEY>` — set it inline, no prompt.
2. The stored config file — set on a previous run.
3. `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` environment variable (e.g. `GLM_API_KEY`,
   `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) — used and saved for next time.
4. Interactive prompt — asked for automatically if none of the above is set.

## Manage config

```bash
<name>claude config              # redo full setup (URL + models + key), interactive
<name>claude config <KEY>        # change just the stored key, no prompt
<name>claude set-url <URL>       # change just the base URL
<name>claude set-model <MAIN> [HAIKU]   # change the model name(s)
<name>claude set-effort <LEVEL>  # pin effort, or 'off' to control it in-session
<name>claude set-context <MODE>  # context window: 1m | default | auto
<name>claude set-permissions <MODE>  # ask (prompt first) | skip (no prompts)
<name>claude reset               # delete the stored config (keep the command)
<name>claude uninstall           # remove the config AND the command itself
```

`change-key`/`change`/`set-key` are accepted as aliases for `config`;
`change-url`/`url` for `set-url`; `change-model`/`model` for `set-model`;
`change-effort`/`effort` for `set-effort`; `change-context`/`context` for
`set-context`; `permissions`/`perms` for `set-permissions`; `remove` for
`uninstall`.

### Permission prompts (ask vs skip)

**By default Claude asks before running tools** (edits, shell commands, API
calls) — the safe choice, especially for a third-party/aggregator model or
production work. If you want the fast, no-prompt flow instead:

```bash
<name>claude set-permissions skip  # run tools without asking (--dangerously-skip-permissions)
<name>claude set-permissions ask   # back to prompting before each action (default)
```

> Only `skip` disables the prompts; anything else (including a brand-new
> install) keeps them on. Use `skip` only in a directory/endpoint you trust.

### Context window (1M vs 200K)

Claude Code assumes a **200K-token** context window for any model it doesn't
recognize — which is every third-party model. So the wrapper **auto-detects it
for you**: on first setup and whenever you `set-model`, it reads the model's
advertised `max_input_tokens` from the provider's OpenAI-style `/v1/models`
endpoint and picks the right window (needs `python3`; falls back to 200K if the
provider doesn't report it). You normally don't have to think about it.

To override manually:

```bash
<name>claude set-context 1m       # force the 1M window
<name>claude set-context default  # force the standard 200K window
<name>claude set-context auto     # re-detect from the provider now
```

Under the hood, `1m` appends the `[1m]` suffix Claude Code uses to select its
1M window — and Claude Code **strips that suffix before the request reaches
your provider**, so the provider still sees the plain model name.

### Effort level

By default the wrapper does **not** set a fixed effort level, so the `/effort`
command works normally inside the session and persists to your Claude Code
settings. If you'd rather pin it (e.g. always max on a cheap model), run
`<name>claude set-effort max` — valid levels are `low`, `medium`, `high`,
`xhigh`, `max`. Pinning it exports `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`, which **takes
priority over — and disables — in-session `/effort`**; run
`<name>claude set-effort off` to hand control back to `/effort`.

## Update

```bash
<name>claude update    # pull the latest version of this script
```

| Platform        | Where config is stored                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS / Linux   | `~/.config/<name>claude/config` (perms `600`)              |
| Windows         | `%APPDATA%\<name>claude\config` (ACL: you only)             |

It is stored in plaintext on your machine — anyone with access to your user
account can read it. Treat it like any other local credential.

## What it sets

```sh
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="<the configured base URL>"
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="<the configured API key>"
ANTHROPIC_MODEL="<main model>"          # + "[1m]" suffix if context = 1m
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL="<main model>"      # + "[1m]" if context = 1m
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL="<main model>"    # + "[1m]" if context = 1m
ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL="<the configured haiku/cheap model>"
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL="<the configured haiku/cheap model>"
# CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL is set ONLY if you pinned one via set-effort
```

Then runs `claude "$@"` — adding `--dangerously-skip-permissions` **only** if
you ran `set-permissions skip` (by default Claude prompts before each tool).

> **Note:** `--dangerously-skip-permissions` lets Claude run tools without
> per-action approval prompts. Convenient, but commands and file edits then
> execute without asking — only turn it on (`set-permissions skip`) in a
> directory and against an endpoint you trust.

## Uninstall

The simplest way — removes both the stored config and the command itself:

```bash
<name>claude uninstall
```

Run it once per installed command (e.g. `glmclaude uninstall`,
`sumopodclaude uninstall`). On Windows it removes the config and prints the one
line to delete the install folder.

<details>
<summary>Or remove it by hand</summary>

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
rm ~/.local/bin/<name>claude
rm -rf ~/.config/<name>claude
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\<name>claude"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:APPDATA\<name>claude"
```

</details>

> `reset` only clears the saved config (URL/model/key) but keeps the command
> installed; `uninstall` removes both.
